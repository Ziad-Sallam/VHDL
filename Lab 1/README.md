# Problem Statement
### It is required to use VHDL to design and test a 4 bit ripple adder, which adds 2 4-bit inputs introducing sum and carry signals.
## You should implement the following modules:
#### . Half adder.
#### . Full adder using the half adder.
#### . 4-bit ripple adder/subtractor using the full adder.
# Deliverables
#### 1. Complete modular VHDL components.
#### 2. VHDL test benches for each module.



#### 3. Report that includes:
a. Problem statement.

b. Any important design decisions or assumptions.

c. 2 Simulation Samples â€“ at least - for each component (Half Adder, Full Adder, Ripple Adder and Ripple Subtractor).
